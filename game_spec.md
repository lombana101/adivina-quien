# **Game Design: “Who Hid the Shorts?” – Advanced Deduction Edition**

### **Premise**

* One character is the thief who stole the sacred shorts.
* Players deduce the thief using **5–6 limited yes/no questions**, selecting from **predefined broad categories**.
* Each individual trait appears in at least **5 characters**, making **single questions insufficient** to identify the thief.
* The thief is only identifiable after **a combination of answers across multiple categories**.

---

### **Game Flow**

1. **Setup**

   * App generates **8–12 characters per round**, randomly chosen from a pool of 40+.
   * Each character has **12–15 traits** across **8–10 categories**:

| Category     | Example Traits                                       |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Physical     | Short, Medium, Tall; Slim, Average, Muscular         |
| Hair         | Blonde, Brown, Black, Gray; Short, Medium, Long      |
| Shirt        | Blue, Red, Green, Yellow, Pink                       |
| Pants        | Shorts, Jeans, Skirt, Pants                          |
| Accessory    | Hat, Glasses, Scarf, Gloves, None                    |
| Prop         | Book, Doll, Tennis Racket, Backpack, Toy, Headphones |
| Pose         | Standing, Sitting, Leaning, Crossed Arms             |
| Mood         | Nervous, Confident, Smug, Happy, Calm                |
| Color Accent | Red, Orange, Yellow, Blue, Purple, Green             |

* **Trait overlap rule:** Each individual trait appears in **at least 5 characters**.
* **Character uniqueness:** Each character is identifiable **only by the unique combination of traits**, not by a single feature.

---

2. **Question Phase**

* Players have **5–6 questions** per round.
* Questions are **category-based** and **preselected from menus**.
* Example:

  * “Is the thief tall?” (Physical)
  * “Does the thief have an accessory?” (Accessory)
  * “Is the thief holding a prop?” (Prop)
* Yes/no answers always **narrow the pool partially**, never immediately solving the round.

---

3. **Deduction Phase**

* Players track overlapping traits across multiple questions.
* **No single yes/no answer eliminates the thief**.
* Must combine answers to narrow down **to the unique combination** that matches the thief.

---

4. **Guess Phase**

* Players select a character as the thief after their questions.
* Optional: partial scoring for players who **correctly eliminate some options but guess wrong**.

---

5. **Scoring**
   | Action | Points |
   |--------|--------|
   | Correct guess | 50 |
   | Correct guess using ≤3 questions | +10 bonus |
   | Fastest correct guess | +5 bonus |
   | Incorrect guess | 0 |

---

✅ **Design Principles Implemented:**

* Every **individual trait is shared by at least 5 characters**.
* Each character is **unique only by the combination of traits**.
* **Yes/no answers never isolate a single character**. Players must combine multiple questions to deduce the thief.


# **Game UI & Flow Design**

## **1. Landing / Home Screen**

**Purpose:** Entry point for all players, with options to create/join a session.

**UI Elements:**

* Title: “Who Hid the Shorts?”
* Buttons:

  * **“Start a Round (Head Master)”** → leads to head master setup
  * **“Join a Round”** → prompts 4-digit session ID input
* Optional: Leaderboard / Stats / Settings button

**Notes:**

* Clean layout with cartoonish/fun style characters visible in the background for thematic consistency.

---

## **2. Head Master Setup Screen**

**Purpose:** Allows the main player (head master) to configure the game.

**UI Elements:**

* Input: **Number of characters for the round** (slider or numeric input, e.g., 8–12)
* Button: **“Start Round”** → generates:

  * Random subset of characters
  * Randomly selects thief
  * Returns **4-digit session ID**

**Feedback:**

* Display **Session ID** prominently
* Show **QR code** optionally for easy joining
* Display number of allowed questions per player

---

## **3. Join Round / Guesser Screen**

**Purpose:** Other players join as guessers.

**UI Elements:**

* Input: **4-digit session ID**
* Display: **Player names already joined**
* Button: **“Ready”**

**Interaction:**

* Players join the same round asynchronously
* Each guesser sees **all characters in a grid**, initially unblurred

---

## **4. Main Game Screen**

**Layout:**

* **Top Bar:**

  * Timer (if desired)
  * Question count remaining
  * Player scores / leaderboard mini-panel

* **Character Grid:**

  * Shows **all characters in the round** (thumbnail portraits with traits hidden)
  * Initially all characters visible

* **Question Panel (Left or Bottom):**

  * Shows **predefined question categories**
  * Players select one question → submit → receive Yes/No answer

* **Dynamic Filtering (Blur / Block System):**

  * After the **head master (or designated main player) answers a question**, the game calculates which characters **don’t match the response**
  * These characters are **blurred or darkened** for guessers
  * Example: If the main player answers “Yes, the thief is tall,” all characters that are **not tall** become blurred

* **Guess Panel:**

  * After questions, players can select a character as their guess
  * Confirmation popup: “Are you sure?”
  * Feedback only after the round ends

---

## **5. Player Feedback / Round End Screen**

**UI Elements:**

* Display **the thief revealed** (highlighted character)
* Show **player guesses and scores**
* Optional: show **who was closest** if incorrect
* Buttons:

  * **“Next Round”** (head master chooses)
  * **“Return to Lobby”**

**Notes:**

* Use cartoonish, fun highlights to celebrate correct guesses or funny fail animations

---

## **6. Question & Filtering Mechanics**

**Mechanics Details:**

* **Questions are limited** (5–6 per round)
* Only **predefined broad categories** allowed: height, accessory, prop, pose, mood, color accent
* When the main player answers a question:

  1. Game calculates **traits matching the answer**
  2. **Characters that don’t match** are blurred or greyed out for all guessers
  3. This **progressively narrows the grid** as more questions are answered

**Example:**

* Question: “Is the thief wearing an accessory?” → Main player answers “Yes” → all characters without accessories are blurred

---

## **7. Multi-Session Flow**

**Roles:**

* **Head Master:** Chooses characters, knows thief, provides Yes/No answers to guessers’ questions
* **Guessers:** Join via session ID, ask questions from predefined menu, see filtered characters dynamically

**Session ID Flow:**

1. Head master starts a round → 4-digit session ID generated
2. Guessers enter session ID → join grid of characters
3. Round starts → guessers ask questions
4. Head master answers each question → dynamic filtering updates guessers’ view
5. Players submit guesses → round ends → scores displayed

---

## **8. Additional UI/UX Features**

* **Leaderboard:** Real-time or per-round cumulative scores
* **Character Tooltip:** On hover/tap, shows **category icons only** (not unique traits) for guessing strategy
* **Animations:**

  * Blur transitions smoothly as characters are filtered
  * Highlight thief at end with humorous animation (shorts flying, confetti, etc.)
* **Mobile-first Layout:**

  * Grid adapts to device width
  * Questions panel scrollable if needed
